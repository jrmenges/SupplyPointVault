## 📱 About the App

SupplyPoint Vault is an Android application (iOS coming soon) that allows responsible gun owners to:

- Log firearm details: models, calibers, type, action, and more  
- Track ammo purchases, usage, details, and per-round costs  
- Manage accessories and link them to specific firearms  
- Record range day sessions with notes and usage which syncs to ammo inventory 
- Export data to CSV for backup or reporting  
- Store all data locally — nothing is uploaded to the cloud  

> 🔐 Designed with privacy in mind. All data is stored only on your device.

## 👤 About the Creator

The idea for SupplyPoint Vault started from my own personal need for a simple, secure, and easy-to-use way to manage my growing collection of firearms, ammunition, and accessories.

As someone once labeled a **"super gun owner"** by the media, I quickly realized that maintaining an accurate and complete inventory wasn’t just helpful — it was essential for **security, organization, and potential future insurance needs**.

What began as a personal project evolved into something I wanted to share with the entire gun-owning community. SupplyPoint Vault is built by someone who understands the challenges and needs of responsible ownership — and who values privacy and control just as much as you do.

## 🔐 Privacy Policy

Welcome to **SupplyPoint Vault** — the app that minds your business, not anyone else's.

This privacy policy explains how we handle your information (or rather, how we don't).

### 1. Information We Collect
SupplyPoint Vault stores all your data — firearm details, ammo logs, photos, range notes — **on your device only**.  
We don't upload it, sync it, or even peek at it.  
**No servers. No accounts. No tracking.**

Because when it comes to your personal records, we believe Big Brother should stay out of the gun safe.

### 2. Permissions We Request (But Only When Needed)
To make this app useful, we might ask for:

- **Camera** – so you can snap pics of your gear  
- **Storage** – to save those pics right on your phone  

That's it. No secret data harvesting. No background snooping.

### 3. Who We Share Your Data With
**You. Just you.**  
We don't share your info anywhere. No cloud syncing, no analytics, no sketchy ad networks.  

You're the only one with access to your records — and we think that's how it should be.

### 4. Your Control
- Want to delete your stuff? Go for it.  
- Export it? Yep, there's a button for that.  
- Burn your phone and toss it in a lake? That's on you.  

We don't lock you into anything. It’s your data.

### 5. Policy Updates
We might update this privacy policy from time to time — and when we do, you’ll see it here. No sneaky changes.

### 6. Questions or Concerns
You can reach out at **questions@supplypointvault.com**.  
We're happy to help (but still not collecting your data).
