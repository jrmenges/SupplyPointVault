## 📱 About the App

SupplyPoint Vault is an Android app that helps you securely log and manage:

- 🔫 Firearms (make, model, caliber, serial, photos)
- 🧱 Ammo (type, grain, purchases, cost per round)
- 🎯 Range sessions (with notes and usage tracking)
- 🎒 Accessories (with support for linking to specific firearms)

All data is stored **only on your device** — no accounts, no servers, no tracking.
